# Applied Data Science Specialisation Capstone - Final

Stockholm County segmentation and clustering using location data from the Foursquare API.

## Description

You are so passionate about Pizza and Pizza making that you decide to make money out of it. You decide to open your brand-new Pizza place in Stockholm County. Stockholm, said to be the capital of Scandinavia, is also one of the leading food-tech hubs in the world. You have almost figured out everything you want to do in the restaurant; menu items, prices, weekend specials, even your Christmas offers.

Nevertheless, one thing keeps bugging you- the location of your Pizza place. Locations, as they say, can make or break businesses. Moreover, that very well goes for where people choose to eat. Should it be at the centre of the city? Should it be where all the other Pizza places are? You are confused about where to start looking at, for the least.

This solution helps you that this solution will give you a great starting point for locations with excellent business potential. In this solution, we help find a group of similar neighbourhoods (or districts) in Stockholm County with Pizza places as the most common venue type for most neighbourhoods. How does that help, you ask? Neighbourhoods with well-established Pizza place businesses should be good for your new business too. However, if there are too many similar businesses already in the neighbourhood, you would want to know other neighbourhoods that are very similar to this one in terms of their Pizza businesses and could accommodate more such places. It is the reason why this solution gives you not one neighbourhood but also find similar neighbourhoods. We do this by clustering Stockholm County neighbourhoods together based on the types of different venues present in the neighbourhood. So, if you have too many well-established and flourishing Pizza place businesses in a neighbourhood, you can go for a similar neighbourhood (based on your other specific requirements), which does not have too many of such joints but does have a potential for profits for a new joint if you open one.

This project was created as part of the IBM Data Science Professional Certification Final Project.

## Getting Started

### Usage

The analysis is presented in ```Where to Open your Pizza Place - With the Power of Clustering (v2).pdf``` and the code for analysis in ```the_battle_of_neighbourhoods.ipynb```. The code is in Python; hence, Python and optional tools like Jupyter Notebook are required to run the code. In addition, the images used in the report are present separately for easy access to the information.

However, this repository also stores the data used for analysis in ```SE_geo_data.txt```.
